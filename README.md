## Notice

This code was never released as a gem. At the time I was writing I thought it
was something we would need internally. However, that turned out to not be the
case.

Consequently I have no need of this, but am happy to turn it over to someone
who might find it useful. If interested, please contact me offline and we can
discuss transferring the repository. In the meantime, this repository has been
archived.

## Known Bugs
None that I'm aware of. Please report bugs on the project page at:

https://github.com/djberg96/rslp

## Future Plans
None at this time.

## Maintenance
Please contact me about taking over maintenance of this library if you are
interested. I'm not actually using it myself, so maintenance and releases
will be sporadic at best.

Why then? I originally wrote most of this when I thought we might need it
for a project at work. That never materialized, but I hated to let it go to
waste, so I've published what I completed and may occasionally tinker with
it from time to time.
